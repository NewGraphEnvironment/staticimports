# The implementation of `df_to_rowlist` above is the fastest way I've found to
# convert a data frame to a list of named lists (other than `purrr::transpose`,
# which is implemented in C and also marked as superseded). In the benchmarks
# here, it is named `nested_for`: https://rpubs.com/wch/1008771


# Convert a list of named lists to a data frame. This is the inverse of
# `df_to_rowlist`.
#
# Each "row" list can contain the keys in any order. The key order from the
# first "row" will be used for the columns in the data frame.
#
# This function assumes that all columns are present in the first "row" of `x`.
# If later "rows" contain more columns, it will throw an error.
#
# Note that it can't correctly handle factors -- they will get converted to
# integers. But that should be OK, because the input data will generally have
# strings instead of factors.
